This project is private.

It is adjusted for my own purposes and may require other software that is not available to public.

You are allowed to browse and fork the code and use resulting builds for your own, non commercial, purposes.
However, no further rights (e.g. support or the right to publish or own builds) are granted.


This plugin adds a Town/Faction system to Bukkit. It is far from being perfect and 
there are most likely way better plugins available on dev.bukkit.org than this (e.g. Towny or Factions).

It was created for the special needs of the Craftlancer.de Minecraftserver.

This plugin is NOT intended to be released on dev.bukkit.org!
